## Inflation Data Coming Ahead of December Fed Meeting

Market watchers will be focused on November inflation data this week that will be closely examined by the Federal Reserve ahead of an upcoming interest-rate decision.

The Wednesday release of November’s CPI follows an [uptick in October’s inflation rate](https://www.investopedia.com/consumer-price-index-cpi-inflation-stayed-stubborn-in-october-8744407) to 2.6%. Other recent inflation readings also have moved higher, keeping the rate of price increases above the Federal Reserve’s target level.

Also coming this week is the [Producer Price Index (PPI)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ppi.asp) for November, which will show how inflation is affecting wholesalers. And the import/export price index release on Friday provides a look at inflation in foreign trade.

The inflation readings are among the last data that the Fed will get before its meeting next week, where officials will debate whether to again reduce the federal funds rate that influences other borrowing costs across the economy. While many investors believe that the Fed will make a cut at the meeting, some Fed officials have said they are [closely reviewing inflation data](https://www.investopedia.com/despite-inflation-worries-fed-officials-see-need-for-more-rate-cuts-8754689) before making a decision on [whether to lower rates](https://www.investopedia.com/why-one-fed-official-thinks-interest-rates-at-appropriate-levels-8756177). Federal Reserve officials are in a blackout period this week, meaning they won’t make comments on [monetary policy](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100314/whats-difference-between-monetary-policy-and-fiscal-policy.asp).

Story Continues

Other economic indicators for release this week include October’s wholesale inventory data on Monday, small business optimism on Tuesday, and weekly initial jobless claims on Thursday.
